Hangman Game Instructions:
1. A random word is selected from one of three categories: Car, Animal, or Fruit/Vegetable.
2. The first letter of the word is revealed; the rest are hidden as underscores.
3. You have 7 attempts to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.
4. Each correct guess reveals all occurrences of that letter.
5. Each wrong guess draws one more part of the hangman and reduces your remaining attempts by one.
6. If you guess all the letters before using up all attempts, you win!
7. If you use all 7 wrong guesses, the game is over and you lose.
8. Use the Game menu to start a New Game, view Instructions, or Exit at any time.
Good luck and have fun!
